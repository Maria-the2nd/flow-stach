# Convex Backend

This folder contains Convex backend functions.

## Structure

- `schema.ts` - Database schema (to be implemented by intern)
- `_generated/` - Auto-generated types and API (run `convex dev` to generate)

## Getting Started

1. Run `bunx convex dev` to start the Convex dev server
2. This will generate types in `_generated/`
3. Create your schema in `schema.ts`

See docs/runbook.md for full setup instructions.
